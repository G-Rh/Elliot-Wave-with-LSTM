# Elliot-Wave-with-LSTM
Combining Elliott Wave Theory with LSTM for Stock Market Prediction
A new approach to combining technical analysis and deep learning was proposed to predict Elliott wave points in the stock market.
First, technical analysis was used to identify Elliott wave points. These points were then passed to a long short-term memory ( LSTM ) model, which was trained to predict the next Elliott wave points. The LSTM model was also able to predict the next point in the stock price.
We first used a long short-term memory ( LSTM ) model to predict stock prices. We then used a new method called EWP - LSTM , which combines LSTM with Elliott wave theory. We found that EWP - LSTM had a significant improvement in accuracy, with an increase of about 90%.
